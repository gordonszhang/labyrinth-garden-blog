Hi folks, pikcel here. I've been working on this project solo for a little over 2
years now, but I finally decided to stop procrastinating and start a development blog.
So here it is, a blog for my game.

## Introducing Labyrinth Garden

Labyrinth Garden is a 2D action puzzle platformer, developed in Unity. It takes
heavy inspiration from classic platform games like Megaman Zero and Cave Story.

But the game that really motivated me to start making games was rdein's
[Momodora III](https://rdein.itch.io/momodora-iii). You can probably see the resemblance in Labryinth Garden's sprite work, haha.

Anyway, on to the game.

## Story: A maze of mystery

Labyrinth Garden follows Lily, a young woman living in the city of August.
As the seat of the influential Mage's Guild, or Highgarden, August has strong ties to the world
of magic--the rare ability to manipulate Ether.

However, the invention of Pendants, autonomous devices powered by Ether, threatens
to upset a balance of power that's existed for generations. Suddenly finding themselves
behind the times, Highgarden is forced to sign a deal with Vertech, a rapidly
expanding power company. 

While Vertech's network of refineries brings economic stability to August,
the city remains deeply divided. Magic versus technology. 
Roots versus Leaves.

The game's events follow Lily as she dives into the heart of a conflict between
two factions and uncovers the truth behind it all.

## Gameplay: Mixing old and new
Labyrinth Garden's combat takes cues from platform fighters like Super Smash
Brothers and Rivals of Aether. Lily has access to a variety of grounded and 
aerial attacks which can be executed by holding various directions and attacking.
This enables the player to string together hits into fluid combos!

Lily also controls a Pendant, an Ether-powered drone that manipulates Ether
according to specific ability programs. These abilities can be used in fights,
but are also the key to puzzles scattered throughout the game's areas.

## More to come

I'm taking this blog as a personal exercise--document my game development journey
and record any knowledge I come across on the way. 

What to expect:
* Unity and general game development **tutorials**, explaining how I go about solving various problems
* **Showcase** posts, to show off Labyrinth Garden's progress
* And general **updates** when major milestones come up.

For now, good night!
