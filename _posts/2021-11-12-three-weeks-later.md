It's been about 3 weeks since I started this blog, and honestly I've been so
busy adding features to Labryinth Garden that I almost completely forgot about it.

As a personal exercise, I figured I'd take some time to do a little
retrospective, and also lay out my plans for the rest of the year.

In the last 3 weeks, I've:

-   Added sound effects.
-   Added new puzzle elements for the second level, like conveyors, jump pads,
    "tether balls", time fields, and scale platforms.
-   Added some puzzles for the second level.
-   Also, finished the cutscenes for the first intermission
    (in between missions 1 and 2).

Been getting into the swing of things with Twitter, and it's been a great
motivator for me. I'm most proud of this particular post.

But as with all things, having a social media presence is a double-edged sword.
Obsessing over likes and followers is definitely a struggle.

For the rest of the year, here's my rough roadmap.

-   11/15 - Work on puzzles, assets, and scripted events for mission 2
-   11/22 - Vacation
-   11/29 - Vacation
-   12/06 - Finish mission 2 puzzles
-   12/13 - Finish mission 2 boss
-   12/20 - Finish mission 2 assets
-   12/27 - Cleanup, possible demo for new year??

Obviously this is really optimistic, but I want to set a goal to finish the
second level of the game before 2022. Hopefully having this sort of roadmap
will help me pace myself.
